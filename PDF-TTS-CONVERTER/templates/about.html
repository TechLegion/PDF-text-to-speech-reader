 <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>This project, <strong>PDF to Text Speech Converter</strong>, is developed as part of the final year requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Redeemer's University. The primary aim of this project is to create a tool that converts PDF documents into spoken text, enhancing accessibility and usability for individuals with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory learning.</p>
    <p>The project is supervised by [Supervisor's Name], a distinguished professor in the Department of Computer Science at [University Name]. This tool leverages advanced text-to-speech technology to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for converting written content into natural-sounding speech.</p>
    <p>Key features of this project include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy-to-use interface for uploading and managing PDF files.</li>
        <li>High-quality text-to-speech conversion with adjustable speech parameters.</li>
        <li>Support for multiple languages and accents.</li>
        <li>Downloadable audio files for offline use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The development of this project involved extensive research and implementation of various software engineering principles, ensuring a robust and scalable solution. We hope this tool serves as a valuable resource for those in need of text-to-speech conversion capabilities.</p>
